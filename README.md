## ATM Kata

In this project I tried to port Piergiuliano Bossi's [video about Evolutionary Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C94BmuMi8Bo) from Java to Rust.

The last part of the video (the one about currency) is not complete. 

Pierluigi's video is in italian, you can read Pietro Di Bello's note in english [here](https://hackmd.io/5TLyrYN-Tc-3tihcuuuUiw?view).
